This repository aims to provide a set of Javascript components for visualisation of scientific data, 
especically chamical data.

The aim is to provide a consistent set of APIs and user intefaces across a range of components that 
can be used in downstream projects.

The repository has just been created (March 2017) and currently has little content.

* [3D molecule visualisation](ngl/README.md) using [NGL viewer](https://github.com/arose/ngl)

We aim to have a range of visualisation tools, based around the [D3 toolkit](https://github.com/d3/d3)
for standard data visualisation and more specialist tool for chemical display.
